									<h2>Alberta Minister's Youth Council</h2>
									<p>MYC is a council that consists of 40 high school students across Alberta, who come together three times during the school year to learn about Alberta's education system, advocate for minority groups, and provide their insights to the Minister of Education. I was a member of the council during the 2023-2024 school year, and I'm very excited to return for the 2024-2025 year as well. MYC has been an incredible experience, and I have learned invaluable information and met very intelligent individuals. I absolutely love learning about budget allocation within education, the incorporation of First Nations education in the K-12 system, the improvement of life management courses, and so much more. I truly enjoyed every minute I spent learning and sharing, and continue to be grateful for the opportunity to advocate for rural communities and equal opportunities regardless of one's background.</p>

									<h2>My work in Brain-Computer Interfaces</h2>
									<p>In September of last year, I stumbled upon the vast, intriguing world of modern technology. Of course I knew about it, but many emerging technologies aren't as well-known. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were a technology that genuinely left me awestruck. Simply put, a BCI is a device that allows for a person's neural signals to be relayed to an external device, through which the person can communicate and perform tasks without actually using their neuromuscular output pathways. At around the same time, I became interested in cancer research. So, I decided to look into a crossover area: using a BCI to monitor a brain tumour. I wrote an article about this potential area, but soon realized that I still had a lot to learn before diving deeper into the cancer component that intrigued me. I decided to make myself a sort of "curriculum", which included projects I wanted to do before revisiting my intial idea. I began by simply comparing a person's brain waves when listening to calming and native music. Then, I did another project, aiming to learn about different EEG classification algorithms (just like it sounds: an algorithm that classifies different EEG signals). Now, I'm working on creating a predictive model to differentiate between different neural states, such as relaxation and concentration. PS. All the articles I've written are on my medium page, linked at the bottom of this page.</p>
									<p>In May of 2024, I went to a SUPER exciting conference in Calgary, Alberta, called Inventures. Genuinely one of the best days ever. I learned a ton about nanotech, AI, robotics, and neurotech as well. But the biggest milestone for me was speaking on a panel. Titled "Ignite: Youth in Innovation", my panel consisted of myself and one other speaker. We discussed our past, current, and aspiring projects, our struggles and triumphs, and it was an incredible journey. I really do look forward to learning more about neurotech, and exploring different components of the area.</p>

									<h2>Newsletter</h2>
									<p>Every single thing that I have done has come with highs and lows, and each project and endeavor I have pursued had challenges. What you have read so far may seem sugarcoated, which is why I also write a newsletter. Transparency is key, and none of my projects have been completed without a bit of struggle. Give my newsletter a read if you want to learn more about my work, mindsets, and anything else that is on this page.</p>
