							<p>Hey! My name's Salma, I'm 15 years old, and I am excited to share some parts of me with you. I love advocating for underrepresented groups through public speaking and partaking in organizations. I also love learning about emerging technologies, especially neurotech. For the past year, I've been exploring the world of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and they have blown my mind. I also enjoy doing physics and math, and I find coding enjoyable, but it's still a bit of a struggle for me. </p>
							<p>Stoicism is my favorite school of philosophy, and I try my best to live by it every day. Outcomes aren't under one's control, but the input very much is. Give my newsletter a read if you're interested in reading about the ups and downs of applying certain mindsets, including stoicism, and learning about what I've been up to and am currently working on!</p>
